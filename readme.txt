Requirements:

(I forgot what the mac os x build of ipod wizard is but its out there...so if you have a mac use that)

Instructions:
1.Download the latest version of photo 5g
2.click firmware file from the edit mode drop down
3.Click write to ipod MAKE SURE THE IPOD IS CONNECTED
there is much more theming to come and edits to be made so stay "tuned"
